# Ragdoll-Physics-Plus
my popular ragdoll improvement mod for Arma 3, now open source.
CPP file is the main code for the mod, SQM is a simple VR testing area with units arranged in various positions, to make your testing a bit easier.
Config_default is the vanilla ragdoll physics code, in case you want to create your own ragdoll mod from scratch.
The CPP file is configured for SP use, if you want to configure for MP then make sure to disable vehicle collisions!
